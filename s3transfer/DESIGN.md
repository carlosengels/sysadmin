# S3 Transfer Tool Design Document

## Overview
A cross-platform (Windows/Linux) application that enables seamless file synchronization between local directories and Amazon S3 buckets, creating a virtual shared drive experience across different computers.

## Core Features
1. **Directory to S3 Upload**
   - Monitor specified local directory for changes
   - Upload new/modified files to S3 bucket
   - Maintain directory structure in S3
   - Handle large files efficiently

2. **S3 to Directory Download**
   - Monitor S3 bucket for changes
   - Download new/modified files to local directory
   - Preserve directory structure
   - Handle file conflicts

## Technical Components

### 1. Configuration
- AWS credentials management
- Source/destination directory paths
- S3 bucket configuration
- Sync interval settings
- File exclusion patterns

### 2. File System Monitor
- Platform-specific file system watchers
- Change detection (new/modified/deleted files)
- Event queue for processing changes

### 3. S3 Operations
- AWS SDK integration
- Efficient file upload/download
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and retries

### 4. Sync Engine
- Change detection and comparison
- Conflict resolution
- Queue management
- Status reporting

## Implementation Considerations

### Security
