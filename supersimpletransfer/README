# S3 Bi-Directional Sync Script

This script syncs files between a local directory and an S3 bucket in both directions, ensuring both sides have all files without deleting anything.

## Setup

1. Move the script to your `~/bin` directory:
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   mv sync-tmp.sh ~/bin/bsync
   chmod +x ~/bin/bsync

2. Add ~/bin to your PATH if it's not already:

    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

3. Usage

    Run sync with 
    bsync
